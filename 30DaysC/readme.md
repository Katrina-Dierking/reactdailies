This is a set of files and folders meant to go with 30 Days of React @ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlxurZn3gw7r7JX_JRfmKqY32IOrSFTSB.<br>
You must install dependencies (`yarn/npm add/install create-react-app`), but the other files are provided here for use with this playlist.  

Suggestion to get started: 

1. Create your own overarching repository that will hold all 30 days as described above and make sure it's also remote
2. cd into overarching repository you just made
3. run `yarn/npm add/install create-react-app`
4. then install CRA dependencies for each day/folder, day01 through day30, by running `yarn create-react-app day##` for each day 01 through 30
5.  Download this folder/repo, 30DaysC, and overwrite all files in your overarching repository
6. run `git add .`
7. run `git commit -m "base project files uploaded"`
8. run `git push` (probably will tell you to do the upstream thing if this is your first push, go ahead and do it)


then for each day/project:
cd into that day's folder/project
create new branch for each day/project
run `yarn start`
do your current day of react
merge branch into your own overarching repo

There will be no set-up the rest of the 30 days because you've just done it all.

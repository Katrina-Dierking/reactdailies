This is a set of files and folders meant to go with 30 Days of React @ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlxurZn3gw7r7JX_JRfmKqY32IOrSFTSB.<br>
You must install dependencies (`yarn/npm add/install create-react-app`) for each day, but the other files are provided here for use with this playlist.  

Suggestion to get started: 

Create your own overarching repository that will hold all 30 days
cd into repository
install CRA dependencies for each folder, day01 through day30 by running `yarn create-react-app day##` for each day 01 through 30
Download this folder/repo, 30DaysC, and overwrite all files in your overarching repository
run `git add .`
run `git commit -m "base initial project files uploaded"`
run `git push (probably will tell you to do the upstream thing if this is your first push, go ahead and do it)`


then for each day/project:
create new branch for each day/project
do your current day of react
merge branch into your own overarching repo

There will be no set-up the rest of the 30 days because you've just done it all.
